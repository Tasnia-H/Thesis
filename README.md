Thesis on Enhancing Bangla Speech Emotion Recognition

As human-computer interaction becomes more prevalent, the ability to identify human emotions assumes increasing importance. Speech, a rich source of emotional cues, offers a promising avenue for emotion recognition. Machines capable of discerning these emotions stand to significantly enhance human-computer interaction and find diverse applications across various domains. In this paper, we undertake the task of classifying seven distinct emotional states – namely, sadness, happiness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, and neutrality – in spoken Bangla. Due to the limited availability of quality datasets, we have compiled a comprehensive dataset of vocal performances in Bangla, meticulously annotating each recording with the expressed emotion and its intensity level. This dataset, created by our research team, is publicly available to facilitate further research and advancement in emotion recognition, particularly in the context of the Bangla language. thereby facilitating the development of more empathetic and responsive human-computer interfaces.
